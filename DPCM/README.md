To encode video, move to directory and type:

`python Encode.py video_name q`

For example:

`python Encode.py look.avi 5`

This will create a folder, "temp", and a file, "save". The folder contains the original frames and the file the compressed binary file. You can compare the two for size difference.

To decode from the "save" file, move to directory and type:

`python Decode.py`
